# Zmix - Java based Peer to peer Network / Onion Routing

This project is an implementation of a simple Peer to Peer Network (Onion Routing) in Java. It's designed to provide a basic understanding of how peer to peer technology works.

[//]: # (## Features)

## Getting started

To quickly get started with the network, docker-compose is used to build and run the Java application inside a Docker container. You simply need to run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up few docker containers, with which circuit can be created and send requests.
